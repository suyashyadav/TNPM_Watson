Problem with  discovery formula,"Please confirm from customer if the formula has been modified by any means at their end, if this is the case then suggest customer to test with GA discovery formula and update if they still face any issue.If everything works fine with GA formula then they should take care of the updated formula by them self and support is not responsible for correcting the customized formula."
CME crash while resynching from formula manager,"below are the steps which helped to resolve the issue:-  1.We received the walkback files from TELUS on 1st Feb and after going through all the walkback logs and discussion with DC L3 team we came to know that CMEs are crashing while doing resync from formula manager. 2.Later we suggested customer to remove the state directory and restart the CME to see if it helps to complete the resynch. 3.As per the update received from customer, it has reduced the frequency but not completely resolved the issue. 4.Yesterday we had a web-ex session with customer and followed the same steps for CME.2.201 after which we did not observe the crash. 5.During the web-ex session, we also noticed that all the LDRs are processing 31st Jan data for 23rd hour and in provios.log continuously showing CHECKLOADREMERGESTATE message. 6.As there were no error in the log or walk-back file related to LDR ,we suggested customer to monitor the processing for a day and update us in case they still dont see any other message for LDR."

TNPM 1.4 Metrics enabled are not coming through,"We have installed Cisco IPSLA pack in our local lab and found that standard discovery formula for IPSLA family are creating instances as RTTMon<integer>.  Please see below standard techpack formula for your ready reference.   Def AllowCreationOfSE 0; Dim I1 AS Integer Default * NAME RTTMonIndex;  V01=OIDINST((rttMonCtrlAdminStatus.%I1==1) && (rttMonCtrlAdminRttType.%I1==9), once); V02=OIDVAL(rttMonEchoAdminTargetPort.%V01, once); V03=OIDVAL(rttMonEchoAdminSourcePort.%V01, once); V04=OIDVAL(rttMonEchoAdminNumPackets.%V01); V05=OIDVAL(rttMonEchoAdminInterval.%V01);  # VoIP Jitter properties; V06=OIDVAL(rttMonEchoAdminCodecType.%V01 format clean, once); V07=Filter((%V06==""notApplicable"") ==0); V08=OIDVAL(rttMonEchoAdminCodecNumPackets.%V01); V09=OIDVAL(rttMonEchoAdminCodecInterval.%V01); V10=OIDVAL(rttMonEchoAdminICPIFAdvFactor.%V01);  # Support for one way statistics; V11=OIDVAL(rttMonLatestJitterOperNumOfOW.%V01);  %V02 + %V07 index ""RTTMonIndex<%V01>||-UNSPECIFIED_LABEL||TestTargetPort<%V02>TestSourcePort<%V03>ProbeCount<*%V08>ProbeInterval<%V09>TestCodecType<%V06>TestICPIFAdvFactor<%V10>OneWaySupport<true>||""; %V02 + %V11 index ""RTTMonIndex<%V01>||-UNSPECIFIED_LABEL||TestTargetPort<%V02>TestSourcePort<%V03>ProbeCount<*%V04>ProbeInterval<%V05>OneWaySupport<true>||""; %V02 index ""RTTMonIndex<%V01>||-UNSPECIFIED_LABEL||TestTargetPort<%V02>TestSourcePort<%V03>ProbeCount<*%V04>ProbeInterval<%V05>||"";  Our Instances are without NULL    Below is the GA collection formula for Probes Succeeded (percent) metric:   Def SaveAlias 29527; Dim I1 AS Integer Default * NAME RTTMonIndex; 100 * rttMonLatestJitterOperNumOfRTT.%I1 / rttMonEchoAdminNumPackets.%I1 * DISTRIB(rttMonLatestRttOperTime.%I1 == last(rttMonLatestRttOperTime.%I1), ""==0:1"");  As you can see we are using only %I1 in our collection formulas. There are no standard formulas with rttMonEchoAdminNumPackets.%I2. PSB screenshot for your ready reference.   This suggests that  discovery results are not expected to generate instances in format RTTMon<NULL>probe<Integer> .  So we would recommend you to involve the formula developer to further troubleshoot this issue."
CMGR is not running,Please check if Visual processes have been started in a correct sequence.The correct sequence is as mentioned below:- cnsw logw cmgrw amgrw  So if the sequence was not correct then kindly kill all the processes and start in the sequence as mentioned above.
TNPM Resource View reports issue,The very first step is to confirm if the report stylesheets are missing.This generally happens with the new install or migration.In case the stylesheets are missing then run the export.sh which will create appropriate directories and then copy required meta files from APStlesheets directory present in DataMart server and run import .sh.
CMEs are running behind,Identify if any custom CME formula has been recently deployed at customer end and if the issue is being just observed after the deployment.If this is the case then please ask customer to remove the formula and update us with their observation.
