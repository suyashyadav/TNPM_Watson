TNPM Resource View reports issue,The very first step is to confirm if the report stylesheets are missing.This generally happens with the new install or migration.In case the stylesheets are missing then run the export.sh which will create appropriate directories and then copy required meta files from APStlesheets directory present in DataMart server and run import .sh.
CMEs are running behind,Identify if any custom CME formula has been recently deployed at customer end and if the issue is being just observed after the deployment.If this is the case then please ask customer to remove the formula and update us with their observation.

TNPM: removing the group (and all of its children),"PMR_No 78171,227,000 Action taken : Sent mail to customer. Hi Vlad, Thanks for joining the call. As discussed in call, the issue is that if we deleted the group today weshould be able to view that till todays date in portal and should not be visible from next day. Example, if we deleted a group on 1st June then we should be able to view that group till 1st June in portal and from 2nd June it should not present. As of current working of TNPM once we delete any group then that group gets completely deleted from portal irrespective of date, months and year, etc. We have replicated same in our local lab. So let me check this scenario with my team and will get back to you withour concrete solution. Regards, Sarvesh"

PMR for TNPM,Action taken : Sent mail to customer. Hi Parvathi From the provided proviso.log we able to see that THRSHEVENT are gettinggenerated for Baseline threshold. Let me explain you the working of Permitted time outside baseline. It generates trap after specific time interval when threshold value is violated. Let say for example Permitted time outside baseline is set to 1min thenwhen threshold value is violated then Permitted time outside baseline will wait for 1 min to see that threshold value is back to normal rangeif not then it will generate trap after 1 min. Ideally it is recommended to set the value of Permitted time outside baseline to your polling interval. Thanks Sarvesh
PMR for TNPM,Action taken : Sent mail to customer. Hi Parvathi Threshold calculation will start after the min days. Like in below two cases.

They were looking for baseline threshold data analysis details. How data will be analysed if we configure baseline thresholds. Also provide the details of trap tokens which we get if there is a threshold violation. ACTION TAKEN: Values given here for Threshold: Max # of days 8 Min # of days 2 Calculation Previous Days Sensitivity Upper 1 Sensitivity Lower 1 Permitted time outside baseline 15mins (Essential to configure according to your polling interval) Event generation Yes Mode Over . Consider the following data has been taken from last 8 days. Like from 24th to today 31st 2 4 4 4 5 5 7 9. . First calculate the average then the standard deviation. . The average will be: (2+4+4+4+5+5+7+9)/8 5 . For the standard deviation first calculate the difference of each data point from the mean and square the result of each: (25)^2 (3)^2 9 (55)^2 0^2 0 (45)^2 (1)^2 1 (55)^2 0^2 0 (45)^2 (1)^2 1 (75)^2 2^2 4 (45)^2 (1)^2 1 (95)^2 4^2 16 . Next calculate the mean of these values and take the square root: sqrt[(9 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 16)/8] 2 So now the threshold value becomes: Threshold value 5+(21)7 (average + number of standard deviations) Also for more details about configuration of baseline threshold you canfollow below link http:www01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBNJ7_1.4.1/dm_config_op/ttnpm_dm_config_op_Threshold_40.html For your second query we cannot configure the baseline threshold for daily weekly and monthly base analysis. It would be possible in Burst threshold by configuring PDef as shown in the below screenshot. Also please follow below link for more details about thresholds. http:www01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBNJ7_1.4.1/dm_config_op/ttnpm_dm_config_op_Threshold_29.htmllangen

Also components will log this FLOW_CTRL_PROCESSING_PAUSED message when there is too much data in the output directory waiting to be acquired bydownstream components You were getting flow control asserted message because the data in CME.x.x directory reached its maximum DO_HOURS limit which by default is4 hours. Also as CME.x.x/do was at its max it was not polling the data from FTE.x.x resulting in FTE going in flow control asserted state. It happens when there is lot of data waiting for getting processed.

Issue with DL/components and stopped collecting data,Action taken : Sent mail to customer. Hi VishwanathMahesh As we have provided the root cause for the issue please let us know if you have any further queries. If not then allow us to close this PMR. Thanks Sarvesh
Issue with DL/components and stopped collecting data,ACTION TAKEN: There may be couple of reasons that may cause issue in moving BOF file (MOVE_FAILED ). It may be caused if below situation occurs 1. When ever there is network issue. 2. When ever BOF file is being processed or used by other component. 3. When ever BOF file is processed partially because of being corrupted. 4. If multiple instance of CME are running & one CME instance move the file & other instance of CME is not able to process data. 5. If the BOF files are not in continuous sequence or any of the BOF file is missing. But as Proviso.log for 2nd of Jan is not available we can not comment

First lets monitor the disk utilization for at least week and then accordingly take the decision whether to increase or not depending upon the utilization. Apart from this we can see that all the component are running fine and catchup the current data. So please monitor the system for next 1 hour and let us know how you would like to move further with this PMR.

UBA pvline performance,ACTION TAKEN: Regarding your question I had a discussion with my team and outcome is that there is no such benchmark to improve performance that is completely dependent on input data that we provide to UBA. Each UBA is different and dependent on the inputdata (in your case custom PVLine inputs) we cant offer any reasonable sizing guidance. It is incumbent on the developer of a tech pack to streamline their packcode in the adaptor or in your case the PVLine inputs to make it the most efficient.

PMR for TNPM,ACTION TAKEN: As you mentioned if there is a violation you can see thrshevent in proviso log So in case you are not getting thrsheven in proviso.log then obviously threshold condition has not been violated. Also Support will be able to help you only if there is any issue in anyfunctionality present in product which I dont think is the situation here. We have an official document for configuring and better understanding of product and my team has already shared with you. Let me give you the details on how Baseline threshold configure and how it work in case its not clear to you : How Baseline threshold configure: http:www01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBNJ7_1.4.1/dm_config_op/ttnpm_dm_config_op_Threshold_40.dita How Baseline threshold works: You do not statically define the baseline it dynamically adapts to historical data. So when you set the Min number of days to 2 you need towait for 2 days for the trap generation to start. How Baseline is calculated: Let us consider the following example for Baseline threshold: Values given here for Threshold: Max # of days 8 Min # of days 2 (Should have minimum 2 days of data for calculation)Calculation Previous Days Sensitivity Upper 1 Sensitivity Lower 1 Permitted time outside baseline 15mins (Essential to configure according to your polling interval) Event generation Yes Mode Over. Consider the following data has been taken from last 8 days. Like from 24th to today 31st 2 4 4 4 5 5 7 9. Now we will calculate the average value and standard deviation. To calculate the standard deviation we compute the difference of each datapoint from the mean and square the result: Next we average these values and take the square root which gives the standard deviation: So from the above now we have AVERAGE 5 STANDARD DEVIATION 2 As of now we have 9 as our today(31st) value As our upper sensitivity is 1. (Definition: Number of standard deviations added to the mean to determine upper threshold level): Threshold value 5+(21)7 (average+number of standard deviations). If in case upper sensitivity is 2: Threshold value 5+(22)9 . As per our example threshold should get violate in case of value is 7 orabove. Note: The value for min number of days cannot be zero. Example on how report looks : Settings for Baseline/Burst in DvNavigator:

You will also notice that the do done and Dm directories are missing from the profile directory which are used by BCOL for transferring inventory information. We would like to know what the purpose of creating this structure was and also what procedure you followed to create this so that we can try it on our own environment. Regards Saurabh

5545 performance manager,ACTION TAKEN: Hi L2 Please check the doc and log and give some advice. Thanks .
5545 performance manager,ACTION TAKEN: Hi Scott Could you please confirm if you are trying to load the topology from database server Also we have command to increase FC_QUOTA which is give below: dccmd debug CMGR self dbCfgAt: AMGR.TNPMKLLNX0125.PERSISTENT.CO.IN.DUS.1.FC_QUOTA put: 3000000000 Here TNPMKLLNX0125.PERSISTENT.CO.IN is a hostname you can change i accordingly. Please use pvuser and source datachannel environment before running above command. You can run below command to check exact configuration value before an after changing the quota: dccmd debug CMGR self dbCfgPrint | grep AMGR This will help you not putting the components into flow control state. Please update us once you make the changes. Regards Sarthak
TNPM 1.3.2 do not send SNMP Trap to Omnibus,ACTION TAKEN: Hi Lee To further troubleshoot this issue we have created a debug patch to getmore verbose logs . Please place this debug patch in DC_HOME/state folder and restart CMEs in question. Now replicated the scenario (with hostname) and share the proviso logs after an hour for further troubleshooting. You can confirm whether the patch is installed or not with below command: dccmd debug CMGR PvIFManager default loadedPatches Also let us know if there is any chance to have WebEx for this issue. Thanks Shailesh
TNPM 1.3.2 do not send SNMP Trap to Omnibus,Action taken : Sent mail to customer. Hi Lee Glad to hear that you identified the issue by your own. So up to some extent debug patch has helped .. (otherwise you havent looked in to that CME :). Thanks for the closure consent. We will proceed with the closure formalities of this PMR. Thanks for contacting TNPM support. Thanks Shailesh
TNPM 1.3.2 do not send SNMP Trap to Omnibus,ACTION TAKEN: I found the problem why traps were not being sent to Omnibus. I had added the hosts/IP to the /etc/hosts file on the Datamart/DB system but the CME was running on another machine. As we only use local hosts file lookup this would of course not work. I have now added the hosts/IP to the /etc/hosts file where the CME is running configured TNPM so Trap Destinations are hostnames restarted CME and I now see event in OMNIbus.

LDR not processing and loading data,Action taken : Sent mail to customer. Hi Ujjwal/Sonny Thanks for your time in WebEx. During the WebEx we have noticed that LDR is going into hung mode during a Calls to Stored Procedure while checking for the DB Extents during the data processing. This procedure is taking around 3+ hours to complete. We have also tried executing the SQLs manually using SQLPlus and the same behavior observed. Hence it concluded something wrong with DB Side. Next Steps 1. Telus to Share AWR Report with Johhny Chang for closure look. 2. Muhammad (TelusDBA) to investigate on Oracle side as to why the SQL on Systems tables are taking time. Do let us know if anything come out of the analysis from your DBA. Thanks Shailesh Hi Sonny Thanks for the update. Sure I will send the invite now for 9:30 PT and will involve our experts to further troubleshoot this issue. Thanks Shailesh

CME Processing Information,Action taken : Sent mail to customer. Hi Srinivas I had discussion with my team regarding your query. Below is the outcomeof that. 1) Do the load balancing immediately. Every hour you delay is another hour of data that the CME will struggle to process and another hour of inaccuracy in the long running aggregations (daily/weekly/monthly) 2) If you want to attempt to preserve as much raw + hourly data as possible let the old CME continue processing and restart it whenever itcrashes. If the CME can process 1 hour of data (even if it blows up immediately after it writes the files) then you are in good shape to minimize data loss. If the CME is not able to process 1 hour of data (and write the BOFs that get sent to LDR) then you may end up needing to delete all of the data between now and the time the load balancing change is applied to inventory/metadata. All aggregations are reset to 0 at the beginning of the period so any data in the daily/weekly/monthly aggregation in the old CME up to the time the load balance change is made will get lost. There is nothing youcan do to fix that. The sooner you make the change the less data you will lose. Thanks Sarvesh
CME Processing Information,Action taken : Sent mail to customer. Hi Srinivas As discussed over call we are moving ahead & closing the PMR. Thanks for update & closure consent on this.

CME Processing Information,ACTION TAKEN: I had discussion with my team regarding your query. Below is the outcome of that. 1) Do the load balancing immediately. Every hour you delay is another hour of data that the CME will struggle to process and another hour of inaccuracy in the long running aggregations (daily/weekly/monthly) 2) If you want to attempt to preserve as much raw + hourly data as possible let the old CME continue processing and restart it whenever itcrashes. If the CME can process 1 hour of data (even if it blows up immediately after it writes the files) then you are in good shape to minimize data loss. If the CME is not able to process 1 hour of data (and write the BOFs that get sent to LDR) then you may end up needing to delete all of the data between now and the time the load balancing change is applied to inventory/metadata. All aggregations are reset to 0 at the beginning of the period so any data in the daily/weekly/monthly aggregation in the old CME up to the time the load balance change is made will get lost. There is nothing youcan do to fix that. The sooner you make the change the less data you will lose.

Duplicate interfaces in TNPM reports,Action taken : Sent mail to customer. Hi Srinivas As the root cause is provided for the issue so please let us know if wecan close this PMR. Thanks Sarvesh
Duplicate interfaces in TNPM reports,Action taken : Sent mail to customer. Hi Srinivas Thanks for an update. Also we will keep this PMR open till next week. Regards Sarvesh
Duplicate interfaces in TNPM reports,ACTION TAKEN: Hi Srinivas Please find below root cause of this issue. When a resource is deleted twice the second deleted entry will not mark as deleted(off state) as the resource is already exists in the database in deleted state. So when a device is deleted twice the second entry will remain in on state even if the device is no longer valid. This is because inventory is not able to create two deleted entries of the same resource. This is a rare case and we cannot prevent this to happen as we cannot control the changes at device end. If at all this issue occurs we have to follow the solution provided in our previous mails to fix this issue. Please let us know if you have any further queries related to this PMR if not then allow us to close the PMR. Thanks Sarvesh

The value of this object MUST be reported as 0 when no probe responses have been received. pingResultsSentProbes: The value of this object reflects the number of probes sent for the corresponding pingCtlEntry and pingResultsEntry. The value of this object MUST be reported as 0 when no probes From the above definitions of the ODIs the OID pingResultsProbeResponses value should always less than pingResultsSentProbes OID value. However in your case sometimes the value of pingResultsProbeResponses OID is greater than pingResultsSentProbes OID value due to which we are observing this negative values in the reports. I dont think there is a problem with the formula here as the no.of probes sent is always should be no.of responses received. So I would request you get in touch with device team to check why we arereceiving incorrect values for these OIDs.

TNPM 1.4 DB size increases for specific channel,ACTION TAKEN: Hi Vivek Please find below analysis on the basis of files provided logs : 1. db05 contains NRAW from Channel 1. A. you have got about 9 billion rows from August October of last year you can purge out of H2 if you run the dbMgr purge tool which looks like about half of the total volume of data on db05. C01_NRAW_000_H0 2016.02.1603 2016.02.1400 52 134118664 C01_NRAW_000_H1 2016.02.1300 2015.10.2300 114 8932165100 C01_NRAW_000_H2 2015.10.2200 2015.08.1300 69 9096238003 B. Do you have the purge set up in cron Based on the amount of datathey have in H2 We would guess that automatic purge is not set up. Once you set this up NRAW data size will level out after you hit your KEEP parameter which is currently set to keep 3 months of NRAW data 2. db14 contains all of the resource and group aggregations (DRA/WRA/MRA/DGA/WGA/MGA) for Channel 5. A. KEEP parameters are set to a little over a year of monthly/weekly/daily aggs. you are only seven months into running your system so at the current parameters the DB size will keep growing untilit hits that year or so mark for the KEEP parameters and then that data will be available to purge. 3. We would suggest to reduce retention parameters that are in line with your historical reporting requirements and set up purging in cron.

TNPM DataBase query,ACTION TAKEN: Hi Srinivas Could you please provide us below information for the further investigation. 1. /opt/datamart/conf/inventory_subelement.txt 2.

TNPM DataBase query,Action taken : Sent mail to customer. Hi Srinivas Thanks for an update. Let me check this with the team and will update you accordingly. Regards Sarvesh
TNPM DataBase query,ACTION TAKEN: We have gone through the available information and it seems there is some misconfiguration in your system. The source of this growth we have narrowed it down to about 450K500K updates( and new)occurring per day from over a total of 37 profiles. Those updates create about 1 million rows every two days and 150 millionrows per year. COX noted that two years ago their device count increase to 2.5 million devices. From the previous queries there are about 550 million rows in the PROP_DESC_HIST table. From a count() on that table for records 20140101 of which there is about 200 million rows with the oldest date being in 2009. So between 2014 till now that is about 350 million rows which roughly aligns with the device increase and the 1million rows/2 days. Specifically one property called RFChannelUtilization has about 374K of the total amount. A percentage number like utilization should be data not a property. Properties are supposed to be like a location name etcand are not supposed to change a lot and a million changes every 2 daysis huge count. What you need to do is reconfigure so that RFChannelUtilization is captured as metric data not metadata because thats what it really is.I think youll need a new set of reports to pull that metric from the metric tables instead of the property tables. That will solve the problem of stopping the growth.

resmgr query for seprp.value change,Action taken : Sent mail to customer. Hi Vlad As per my discussion with internal team your requirement wont be possible from Supports end. We would suggest you contact Services team to get help on this request. The resmgr query will be complex one such as first we have to find out which SEs had the properties Add/Update/Delete and then query just se_hist table only for same. Also if you want know which profile they belong to then with a combination of the two getting the unique SEs (indexes) then query element hist. I hope above pointers will be helpful for Services team. Please let us know if we can close this PMR as this is out of Support scope. Thanks Sarvesh

TNPM inventory grouping runs ALL the rules regardless,Action taken : Sent mail to customer. Hi Vlad It seems that you specific rules added so we suspect if you add the SubElement Collect~ElementGroup side ONLY the inv opt will be fine. Do that first and then do the ogp export to check. Then add from the LTSS side just the CSA and Gateway only NOT the SMTS save and export ogp to check. In the above cases see if the rulefilter|_|group|_|3 appears. Lastly add the SMTS and export and see if a lot of groups have been added to bulk11~rulefilter. We suspected (see excel attachment lines in red) that you have some subelements under g01nmsdev13_0 under the AVC that are static and notgenerated and this could have been due to a previous issue of static/generated. These redlines are based on a dynamic rule and thus should be generated The file we correlated with the previous segp export. Please check if the subelements are still in existence in resmgr subelements for example AVC0100000150301 for element g01nmsdev13_0. Thanks Sarvesh

"snmpconf entries disappear when a device has ""aged",Action taken : Sent mail to customer. Hi Vlad We have successfully replicated this issue in our local. So we have created an APAR IV83319 for this issue. Below is what the work around that will be fixed in this APAR. Please gothrough the below steps as temporary work around. The fix is to modify the PVMHOME/res/C/inventory.res file. 1) backup the file inventory.res.preIV83319 $ cp f inventory.res inventory.res.preIV83319 2) edit inventory.res and search for the line delete_e_table it will have two entries: delete_e_table: elmt_snmp elmt_desc remove elmt_snmp such that the line is just elmt_desc: delete_e_table: elmt_desc 3) Any elements that are marked Deleted_xxxxx and needs the proper read community string will need to be added back into SnmpConf with the same name as the Deleted_xxxxx and resolved with the proper IPAddress and with the appropiate read community string. When the devices are rediscovered the name in the snmpconfshould changeback to the element name without the Deleted_xxxx Should the device become not discoverable and ages out it will again show Deleted_xxxx instead of being removed from the table. Please let us know if we can close this PMR as APAR is in place. Thanks Sarvesh

Bulk Discovery problem,ACTION TAKEN: Hi Vlad The design is like because if a device is completely deleted from the database then the end customers will lose all the historic data. This is why no device is completely removed from the database and it is only marled as deleted by TNPM. Regards Saurabh
discovery (sync) is complaining about elements not in,Action taken : Sent mail to customer. Hi Ed/Vivek The element.dat in synchro is an export of all elements in DB regardlessof profile which is then read into memory for comparison to the inventorys element.dat. During the reading of the synchros element.dat into memory it will report what it sees as duplicates even though it is not related to the profile at hand. It is a just a warning message. So please let us know if you are facing any issue once this message appears in the log. If not then this message can simple be ignored. You do not need to worryabout duplicated_e.dat file having information about the elements from other profiles. Regards Suyash Yadav

TNPM 1.4 Issues with inventory tool and grouping.,ACTION TAKEN: Hi Vivek Could you please provide us the debug trace for the time when you observe this crash so that we can further debug this issue Looking forward to hear from you at your earliest convenience. Thanks Amar
TNPM 1.4 Issues with inventory tool and grouping.,ACTION TAKEN: Shared below resolution steps with customer. 7.All groups populates automatically in Automatic grouping screen though no groups were selected and saved. It seems that whether the profile has no grouping rule or all grouping rules configured for the inventory option the right panel will always show the full tree. It seems to be the same while creating a new profile it will prepopulated it (similar to when no group is defined). However if there is specific rules configured then only those rules willappear when the profile is edited. 8. Trace inventory log shows that Autogrouping is attempting to run rulewhich has not been selected. Depending on what was already in the profile this is the situation where the group value has |_|3|_| in it which is the case here.You cancheck it with below resmgr command : resmgr export ogp colNames npath opt.dbIndex opt.name opt.value filter npath(~profile_name~inventory~rulefilter) This situation arise when you selected all and then removed a rule/rulepath that is not wanted. Then what happens during the save is the remaining rules get saved all the way to ROOTROOT which is causing all rules to be run. The workaround is to not select all but select only the rules you want by first unselecting all then select the rules desired by dragging from left to right. Once you are done with implementing workaround recheck the ouput with below resmgr : resmgr export ogp colNames npath opt.dbIndex opt.name opt.value filter npath(~Profile_name~inventory~rulefilter)
Explanation of the Properties in the Rule Editor,ACTION TAKEN: Answered all customer queries customer agreed to close this PMR.
Utilisation in and out (Percent) over 100%,ACTION TAKEN: Where is the polling time taken from to calculate Utilization percentage e.g. network device or system time of the poller Here by time do you mean the sysUpTime or the polling time If its the polling time then it is the system time from the poller. If you are talking about the sysUpTime that is used in the calculation thenthis time is taken from the device. What is the formula for calculating Outbound and Inbound Utilization (Bits and Octets). The Formula Editor just say Generic Metric You need to look for the Specific Metric in order to check the formula. By default the Utilization formula will be under the path AP~Specific~SNMP~Interfaces. You will find both HC and LC formula under the above mentioned path. By default does Proviso automatically handle 64 Counters Proviso will automatically decide which counter to use (32 or 64 bit). We generally see this kind of an issue when there is a change at device end. For example a device restart will cause counters to reset resulting a data spike in the reports. Could you please send me the CSV export showing above 100% utilization

wujinf(5664):TNPM,Action taken : Sent mail to customer. Hi Scott I am checking for that sample script. Meanwhile can you check with device team regarding that property and update us. Thanks Sarvesh
wujinf(5664):TNPM,ACTION TAKEN: Hi Scott The use of Inventoryhook script comes under customisation so we cannot provide you any example script since we do not support customization. Below are some pointers regarding Inventoryhook script: Hook script is located on the datamart box under $PVMHOME/bin directory and its name is InventoryHook.sh. By default the full pathnameis /opt/datamart/bin/InventoryHook.sh. Using the scripting language of your choice you hook into the case statement in InventoryHook.sh and do any action (through unix commandsor scripts that you wrote) that you need. The names of case statements in InventoryHook.sh are self explanatory:For example BeforeDiscovery section will list the actions/commands to run before the discovery phase; AfterDiscovery lists those to run right after the discovery phase. There are similar case statements for synchronization of elements synchronisation of subelements grouping. The input files to pay attention to here are mainly: subelement.dat and/or element.dat and/or subelement_invariant.dat. In your case the appropriate case statement would be either AfterDiscovery or BeforeSynchroSE You can create a script or use Unix commands that will modify the file subelement.dat and change the property according to your preferance. Once the changes are made the InventoryHook.sh will automatically be used by inventory process. Hope this information has addressed your query. Also since we have answered all your queries we will go ahead and closethis PMR for now. Regards Saurabh

db2 database user and group,Action taken : Sent mail to customer. Hi As per my understanding you had perform below steps to add DB2GTMON into SYSMON_GROUP: Step 1. After creating the DB2GTMON group you executed command db2 update dbm cfg using SYSMON_GROUP db2gtmon We are assuming that you had perform restart activity of db2. i.e. db2 force applications all db2stop force ipclean db2start Step 2 :To take the snapshot of database you executed below commands : source /db2home/db2/sqllib/db2profile db2 get snapshot for all on PV After this step you faced below error message : SQL30082N Security processing failed with reason 24 (USERNAME AND/OR PASSWORD INVALID). SQLSTATE08001 We suspect the value of SYSMON_GROUP is not changed. Could you please confirm the value of SYSMON_GROUP parameter after you execute db2 get snapshot for all on PV command. Let us know if you have any query or confusion on this. Regards Sarvesh Mahajan
db2 database user and group,ACTION TAKEN: The requirement that you want to achieve is not possible because TNPM will not allow to create an alias or alternate db2 instance or group to check the db2 status. You can only login as a db2 instance which you have created during the installation of db2 and the db2 instance owner or group can be anything that you define during the installation of db2. But after the installation there is no way to create an alternate db2 instance or group to get into it.

IBM Java was not properly configured. To check if Java is configured use this command: #java version If it reflects any other form of java then make changes to symlinks which are pointed by #which java command. 3.Keep All permissions of TNPM binaries defauult. Both /opt/db2 and /tmpshould hava sufficient write privileges(but not necessarily 777 everytime.) 4.In rhel 6.5 libcrypto.so.0.9.8e is not present by default in /usr/lib directory so install the package openssl0.9.8e and create a symlink in /usr/lib with the following command. #ln s /usr/lib/libcrypto.so.0.9.8e /usr/lib/libcrypto.so then #export LD_LIBRARY_PATH/usr/lib should be present in dataMart.env 5.Copy the libdb2ci.so.1 and libdb2.so..1 with default permissions from tnpm directory into $database_home/lib32 folder and create symlinks to this by the name libdb2ci.so and libdb2.so.

Device is not properly reporting statistics,ACTION TAKEN: SENT THE BELOW MAIL TO CUSTOMER Hi Ryan This is to inform you that we have received the PMR 26729082000. I checked the screenshot you have provided. Can we have quick web session now This will easy for us to get the complete idea about issue and resolve it faster. Thanks Nilesh
Device is not properly reporting statistics,Action taken : Sent mail to customer. Hi Ryan I have sent you invite. Please join the session. Regards Nilesh Mankar
Device is not properly reporting statistics,ACTION TAKEN: After our investigation we came to know that the requests were not created for this device. So we ran the inventory for the profile in question which is completed successfully. After that we ran the confReload resync all to reload the memory modelhowever it got stuck for a while. Later we realized that the StatusDB is offline which means the collector is not able to connect to DataBase due to which it was not able to create any requests for newly added device. So we restarted the collector which resolved this database connectivityissue as well as reloaded the memory mode. Now we can see that the collector started collecting the data and data flow is happening properly. As discussed please monitor the system for next couple of hours and update us with the status so that we can move further with this PMR accordingly. Meanwhile It seems the collectors are still running with older version of dataload library. We would suggest you to apply our latest dataload patch on which we have fixed multiple issues. Please find below links to download the patch as well as its readme file ftp:delivery04mul.dhe.ibm.com/ecc/hsb/HSDMxNjUyMTAxXzE0NjYxNzQ1MTU1MjdfQm9jVHBaaVF0ag/1.3.2.0TIVTNPMIF0072.tar.gz ftp:delivery04mul.dhe.ibm.com/ecc/hsb/HSDMxNjUyMTAxXzE0NjYxNzQ1MTU1MjdfQm9jVHBaaVF0ag/1.3.2.0TIVTNPMIF0072_en.README
