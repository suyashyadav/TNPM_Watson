TNPM + SDC 2.9 +  Calculating In/Outbound Utilization values incorrectly ,"There was an issue with Inbound/Outbound Ethernet formula calculation under ethernet and ethernet LAG formula tree.We provided updated formula to customer.Reference PMR number is : 16981,035,649",8
collector startup issue,At first we need to check  weather openssl is installed or not and softlink has been created for libcrypto.so or not.Most of the time collector startup issue comes when one of the two steps have not been followed.In the reference PMR 18345 customer has not created softlink and thus they were facing this issue.,7
no data in reports,"Check if DC components are not processing the data and none of the components are in flow control assrted state. If yes then please stop the components, increase the FC_QUOTA and if the files are older than 3 days then clear the backlog data. Once you are done with these steps please restart the DC components.For further investigation and log collection  please refer this technote - http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21508294",6
Does TNPM supports ASM with oracle,No TNPM does not support ASM on oracle,5
LogToFile techpack RT_LOG issue,"Updated libudm.so and libWaveOperator.so was provided to customer along with updated jars. These updated jars and libraries helped customer to reduce the amonut of logging on RT_LOG.Reference PMR number is 81673,220,796",4
flow control asserted,Check for FLOW_CTRL_STATE messages in the log and confirm if consumed space  by DC components has not crossed 90 % of the QUOTA assigned to this DC server.If yes then please increase the FC_QUOTA and restart DC components.For further investigation and log collection  please refer this technote - http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21508294,2
Datachannel threshold not visible in reports,Check if Threshold configuration are properly defined and if the incoming values are actually violating the condition as defined for warning and critical level.,1
missing NRAW data,Check if any error is coming for LDR or CME in proviso.log and confirm if CME is able to do the aggregation or not.Similarly for LDR/DLDR check if there is any issue in loading the data by going through LDR messages in the log.,1
CMEs are running behind,Check the DC configuration and confirm if the parameter AGGREGATION_FIDELITY is set to LOW.If not then set it to low which helps decrease the frequency with which weekly and monthly aggregated valuesare updated by the CME for instance 1hours -&gt; 6 hours,1
CMEs are running behind,Identify if any custom CME formula has been recently deployed at customer end and if the issue is being just observed after the deployment.If this is the case then please ask customer to remove the formula and update us with their observation.,1
